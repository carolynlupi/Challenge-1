# Code Refactor Starter Code
# This is a challenge to refactor the code given to us for this website.
# I have made the HTML & CSS elements semantic and easier to read.
# I have changed the description of the title to match the website's purpose.
# I have also condensed the CSS code to have a cleaner, more organized and precise look.
